= Flickr

A simple tag that will pull photos from the Flickr api and display on your site in an unordered list. The list will show the thumbnail with alt text being the title of the photo, surrounded by a link to view the full photo on flickr.

== Examples

=== Basic text search

To get the first 5 photos that match a search for "pizza":

  <r:flickr api_key="your_key_here" text="pizza" per_page="5" />
  
Where "your_key_here" is your Flickr API key. See http://flickr.com/services/api/keys/apply/ for info on getting yourself a key. These should be the same 10 photos as if you went to the flickr homepage and typed "pizza" into the search box.

The results of this search on your page looks like:

  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/cannikin/3270587567"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3450/3270587567_c9e7da5bb0_s.jpg" alt="IMG_2540" /></a></li>
    <li><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/cannikin/3270580733"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3451/3270580733_6902475867_s.jpg" alt="All you can eat pizza!!!" /></a></li>
    <li><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/cannikin/3271396294"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3311/3271396294_64e21d40ce_s.jpg" alt="Campbell, CA 95008" /></a></li>
    <li><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/cannikin/3270578745"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3393/3270578745_fca7b33dba_s.jpg" alt="A year in the life of... Me! February 10th: Empty Wheelchair on a Tree" /></a></li>
    <li><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/cannikin/3271405472"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3455/3271405472_d213fe350f_s.jpg" alt="IMG_2537" /></a></li>
  </ul>
  
=== Find photos from a particular user

To find only photos from a certain user (like yourself) that are tagged with a given word, you first need to find out your NSID. You can get that by entering your username here: http://www.xflickr.com/fusr/

Once you have that ID you can search only your own photos that are tagged with 'waterfall':

  <r:flickr api_key="your_key_here" user_id="12345678@N00" tags="waterfall" per_page="10" />

== Attributes

See http://flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.html for a full list of attributes you can pass to the tag. All API arguments are available, just use the ones you want as attributes in your tag. 

All attributes are optional except for +api_key+.

Enjoy!
